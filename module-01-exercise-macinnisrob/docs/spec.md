4. Replace any ‘o’ characters in “fullname” to be ‘a’ characters and output the result to the console application (lowercase ‘o’ only!)
5. Ask the user to enter a number larger than 10 (remember to provide a prompt!)
6. Ask the user to enter a number smaller than 10 (remember to provide a prompt!)
7. Output the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number to the console application
